Many of the images in this directory have two files with the same name but a different extension:

* The SVG file, being vector graphics, is best for drawing and modifying.
* The PNG file, being raster graphics, gives more consistent rendering.

The image has therefore been generated as an SVG file and then exported to the PNG file.

So, if you need to modify an image, I suggest the following sequence:

* Edit the SVG file using a suitable editor (I use Inkscape).
* Export the changes to the PNG file, overwriting the old version.
* upload both files.

Note, when exporting in Inkscape:
* Select everything first, this stops an enormous boundary being exported.
* After selecting the file to export to and clicking OK, don't forget to click on export button as well.
