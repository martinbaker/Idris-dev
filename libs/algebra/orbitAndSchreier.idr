 - This type represents a permutation group.

 - FriCAS is a wonderful programs but its documentation is, how can I put

 - The original authors provided minimal documentation apart from a

||| To do this we need to represent the group in a way that does not
||| need to compute or store all the possible elements of the group,
||| yet still be able to calculate:
||| * The order of the group.
||| * Test permutations to check if they are elements of the group.
||| * Express elements as words in the group.
||| To do this we use the theory of stabiliser chains and Schreier's
||| subgroup lemma. This requires us to compute 'base and strong
||| generators'
||| 
||| Acording to wikipedia permutation group software developed by Sims
||| led to the proof of existence of some finite simple sporadic groups
||| such as Higmanâ€“Sims, Lyons and O'Nan groups.
||| 
||| I find it easier to discuss this theory using diagrams so I have put
||| this enhanced documentation on the web page here:

   orb : List Nat
   ||| The Schreier vector (svc) part allows you to compute element

   ||| *  -2 means point not in orbit,
   ||| *  -1 means base point,
   ||| positive value is index of strong generator moving
   ||| given point closer to base point.
   ||| This list of orbits tends to be in a certain order,
   ||| (corresponding to the order of gpbase)that is, stabiliser of
   ||| point 1 (if it exists) is first then the other stabilisers,
   ||| then the final orbit may not stabilise any points.
