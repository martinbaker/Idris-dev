 - This code implements Permutations (subgroups of bijections
 - of a set) using Idris.
 -
 - A given permutation can represent an element of a group.
 - Composition of permutations will then represent the groups
 - multiplication operetion. Which is why concatination is
 - implemented here as (*) operator.
 -
 - Here we consider alternative ways to represent a permutation type such as:
 - * 'preimage-image' coding.
 - * 'vector' coding.
 - * 'cycle' notation.
 - Since they all have pros and cons we need to consider the
 - coding for both and how to convert between them.

 - Some of the ideas for this come from a program called 'Axiom'
 - which contains a permutation implementation authored by
 - Holger Gollan, Johannes Grabmeier, Gerhard Schneider
 - and first created: 27 July 1989. A fork of this program is

||| Implements permutations (subgroups of bijections of a set).
||| Represents the permutation p as a list of preimages and images, i.e
||| p maps preimage to image for all indices k. Elements of set not
||| in preimage are fixed points, and these are the only fixed points
||| of the permutation.
record Permutation set where
   constructor Perm
   preimage:(FiniteSet set)
   image:(FiniteSet set)

||| auxilary constructor - unit
||| This constructs the special permutation that does nothing.
unit : Eq s => Permutation s
unit = Perm empty empty

||| An auxilary constructor that ensures fixpoints are not included.
||| It is therefore safer to use this constructor than the default.
permSet : Eq set => (preim:(FiniteSet set)) ->
                  (im:(FiniteSet set)) ->

||| provided in the form of lists.

||| permutation p.
||| @p permutation
||| @el element
eval : Eq s => (p : (Permutation s)) -> (el : s) -> s
eval p el = lookup el (preimage p) (image p)

||| Multiplcation of permutations represents composition.
||| That is the result is the same a taking the first permutation
||| and applying the second permutation to the result of the first.
||| This is made more complicated because the code needs to insert
||| any points which are fixpoints in one operand but not the other.
