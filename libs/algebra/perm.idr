||| Implements permutations (subgroups of bijections of a set).
||| Represents the permutation p as a list of preimages and images, i.e
||| p maps preimage to image for all indices k. Elements of set not
||| in preimage are fixed points, and these are the only fixed points
||| of the permutation.
record Permutation set where
   constructor Perm
   preimage:(FiniteSet set)
   image:(FiniteSet set)

||| auxilary constructor - unit
||| This constructs the special permutation that does nothing.
unit : Eq s => Permutation s
unit = Perm empty empty

||| An auxilary constructor that ensures fixpoints are not included.
||| It is therefore safer to use this constructor than the default.
permSet : Eq set => (preim:(FiniteSet set)) ->
                  (im:(FiniteSet set)) ->
                  Permutation set
permSet preim im =
  let m = dropFixpoint preim im
  in Perm (fst m) (snd m)

||| An auxilary constructor where the preImage and Image are
||| provided in the form of lists.
permSetFromList : Eq set => (preim:List set) ->
                  (im:List set) ->
                  Permutation set

||| eval returns the image of element (el) under the
||| permutation p.
||| @p permutation
||| @el element
eval : Eq s => (p : (Permutation s)) -> (el : s) -> s
eval p el = lookup el (preimage p) (image p)

||| Multiplcation of permutations represents composition.
||| That is the result is the same a taking the first permutation
||| and applying the second permutation to the result of the first.
||| This is made more complicated because the code needs to insert
||| any points which are fixpoints in one operand but not the other.
