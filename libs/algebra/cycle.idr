||| Cycle, like a list but no repations and loops back.
||| A set of cycles is an efficient way to notate a permutation.
||| @ elem the type of elements
data Cycle : (elem : Type) -> Type where
  ||| Empty cycle
  Nil  : Cycle elem
  ||| A non-empty cycle of length `S len`, consisting of a head element and
  ||| the rest of the cycle, of length `len`.
  (::) : (x : elem) -> (xs : Cycle elem) -> Cycle elem

||| Return an empty cycle.
||| I included this as an auxiliary constructor so that I can not
||| export the built in constructors. This is so that I can enforce
||| the no-duplicates rule.
empty : (Eq elem) => Cycle elem
empty = Nil

||| Does the cycle contain the given element.
contains : (Eq elem) => elem -> Cycle elem -> Bool
contains a [] = False
contains a (x::xs) = if a==x then True else contains a xs

||| insert an element into a cycle only if the cycle does not
||| already contain the element.
||| @e element to be added.
||| @x cycle to be added too.
insert : (Eq elem) => (e:elem) -> (x:Cycle elem) ->
                      Cycle elem
insert e x =
           if contains e x
           then x
           else e :: x

||| returns the size of the cycle.
||| The name 'order' might be confusing but it is the mathematical term.
order : Cycle elem -> Nat
order [] = 0
order (x::xs) = 1 + order xs

||| Construct a list using the given cycle.
||| @set cycle to be converted to list.
toList : (set:Cycle elem) -> List elem
toList [] = List.Nil
toList (x::xs) = List.(::) x (toList xs)

||| Construct a finite set using the given cycle.
||| @set cycle to be converted to finite set.
toFiniteSet : (Eq elem) => (set:Cycle elem) -> FiniteSet elem
toFiniteSet [] = FiniteSet.empty --FiniteSet.Nil
toFiniteSet (x::xs) = FiniteSet.insert x (toFiniteSet xs)

||| Construct a list of lists from a list of cycles.
cyclesToLL : List (Cycle elem) -> List (List elem)
cyclesToLL [] = Nil
cyclesToLL (x::xs) = (::) (toList x) (cyclesToLL xs)

||| Return all elements in a set of cycles.
||| Similar to cyclesToLL but flatten into one list.
cyclesAllElements : List (Cycle elem) -> List elem
cyclesAllElements [] = List.Nil
cyclesAllElements (x::xs) = (toList x) ++ (cyclesAllElements xs)

||| local function used by cycleToPreImImage to track the first
||| element so that we can loop back to it at the end.
||| @c cycle to be converted
||| @first first element

||| Reverse the order of the elements of a FiniteSet.
||| Since order is irrelevant this does not really change the set
||| but 'reverse' is used by 'fromList' to keep the set looking
||| the same as the list.
