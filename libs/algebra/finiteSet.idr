 - A finite set is a set of elements with no duplicates.
 - There are no specific requirements about what the elements are
 - other than:
 - * The elements are all of a given type.
 - * We must be able to determine equality of elements, that is they
 -   must implement 'Eq'.
 -
 - There is no requirement that the elements are ordered, that is the
 - 'Ord' interface is not required.
 - Although a finite set does not need a concept of order, in general,
 - this implementation is guaranteed to maintain the order that the
 - elements were added. This is not part of the mathematical requirements
 - but it is useful for computation.
 -
 - Should FiniteSet have its size as part of its type? That is, should
 - it be implemented like 'List' or like 'Vect'?
 - There are some functions where having the size available at compile time
 - would be useful. Also if finite sets have the same size they are isomorphic
 - and it might be an interesting idea to have such isomorphisms available at
 - compile time.
 - If we take the example of vector spaces then making vectors of different
 - number of dimensions, different types, is very useful because vector
 - addition is only valid
 - if the dimensions are the same. So it helps to have these errors 
 - detected at compile time. However, the situation is different for
 - FiniteSet because the size depends on the contents in complicated ways.
 - For instance:
 - * Duplicate removal can make the size unpredictable.
 - * Functions like 'union' and 'intersection' do not produce a result of
 -   a predicatable size.
 -
 - I did attempt to have 'size' as a type parameter here.
 - https://github.com/martinbaker/Idris-dev/blob/algebraAlt/libs/algebraAlt/finiteSet.idr
 - I had to to use complicated dependant pairs to get this to compile,
 - but it does not have the right information at runtime and I concluded
 - that this was not practical.
 -
 - Before writing this FiniteSet I did a quick search to check if there was
 - any other existing code that I could use but I did not find any.
 - 'fin' only seems to apply to numbers. The code here:
 - https://github.com/jfdm/idris-containers/blob/master/Data/AVL/Set.idr
 - is based on ballanced trees and so only works on ordered sets.

||| FiniteSet: A container which cannot contain duplicates.
||| In general order is not significant in finite sets, however
||| this type does gaurantee that elements will be returned in
||| the same order as they were constructed in. This allows
||| versions where order is significant.
||| @ elem the type of elements
data FiniteSet : (elem : Type) -> Type where
  ||| Empty set
  Nil  : FiniteSet elem
  ||| A non-empty set of length `S len`, consisting of a head element and
  ||| the rest of the list, of length `len`.
  (::) : (x : elem) -> (xs : FiniteSet elem) -> FiniteSet elem

||| Return an empty finite set.
||| I included this as an auxiliary constructor so that I can not
||| export the built in constructors. This is so that I can enforce
||| the no-duplicates rule.
empty : (Eq elem) => FiniteSet elem
empty = Nil

||| Does the set contain the given element.
contains : (Eq elem) => elem -> FiniteSet elem -> Bool
contains a [] = False
contains a (x::xs) = if a==x then True else contains a xs

||| insert an element into a set only if the set does not
||| already contain the element.
||| @e element to be added.
||| @x set to be added too.
insert : (Eq elem) => (e:elem) -> (x:FiniteSet elem) ->

||| The name 'order' might be confusing but it is the mathematical term.
order : FiniteSet elem -> Nat

||| Reverse the order of the elements of a FiniteSet.

||| Convert a list to a finite set.
||| If the list contains duplicates then only one element of each
||| value will be added.
|||
||| The length of the list should be statically known.
fromList : (Eq elem) => (l : List elem) -> FiniteSet elem

||| order is not significant when comparing sets so equality returns true
||| if both sets contain the same elements regardless of order.

  (==) [] [] = True
  (==) [] _ = False
  (==) _ [] = False
  (==) a b = (order (difference a b) == 0 ) && (order (difference b a) == 0 )

||| This is a stricter version of equality test which requires both
||| parameters to have their elements in the same order. Although presevation
||| of order is not a general requirement of a finite set this type does
||| gaurantee not to change the order of the set.
identical : (Eq elem) => (FiniteSet elem) -> (FiniteSet elem) -> Bool
identical [] [] = True
