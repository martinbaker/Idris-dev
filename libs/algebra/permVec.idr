 - This code implements Permutations (subgroups of bijections
 - of a set) using Idris.
 -
 - A given permutation can represent an element of a group.
 - Composition of permutations will then represent the groups
 - multiplication operetion. Which is why concatination is
 - implemented here as (*) operator.
 -
 - Here we consider alternative ways to represent a permutation type such as:
 - * 'preimage-image' coding.
 - * 'vector' coding.
 - * 'cycle' notation.
 - Since they all have pros and cons we need to consider the
 - coding for both and how to convert between them.

||| auxilary constructor - unit

||| Multiplcation of permutations represents composition.
||| That is the result is the same a taking the first permutation
||| and applying the second permutation to the result of the first.
||| This is made more complicated because the code needs to insert
||| any points which are fixpoints in one operand but not the other.
