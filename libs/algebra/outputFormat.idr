||| CharRectangle is a type synonym for a 2D array of characters.
||| This is intended to be used for output in a fixed-width font.
||| No need to have dimensions at the type level because the validity of
||| operations will not depend on width or height.
||| Functions will assume all rows are the same width, this must be enforced
||| by constructors.

||| Constructor to create single line rectangle
